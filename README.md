# pokemon-getter
A simple program that prints Pokémon names to a text file using Paul Hallett's [PokéAPI](https://github.com/phalt/pokeapi).

### Not very exciting?
I know, but it was a good learning exercise. I hope to make it do more interesting things as I further my knowledge. Feel free to open a pull request and help build something awesome.
